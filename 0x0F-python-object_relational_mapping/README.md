## 0x0F. Python - Object-relational mapping

### Background Context

In this project, I interacted with a MySQL database using Python.

In the first part, I used the module MySQLdb to connect to a MySQL database and execute SQL queries.

In the second part, I used the module SQLAlchemy an Object Relational Mapper (ORM).

#### Learning Objectives
The following learning objectives are covered: 

| Concept  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 1) Connecting to a MySQL database from a Python script |  Established a connection between your Python script and a MySQL database to perform operations like querying and data manipulation |
| 2) SELECTing rows in a MySQL table from a Python script | Understand how to retrieve specific data from a MySQL table using SELECT statements in your Python script. This allowed fetching and displaying  relevant information from the database |
| 3) INSERTing rows in a MySQL table from a Python script | Discover how to insert new records into a MySQL table using INSERT statements in your Python script. So as to enable adding  data to the database dynamically |
| 4) Understanding ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) | The concept of ORM and its significance in connecting object-oriented programming with relational databases. |
| 5) Mapping a Python Class to a MySQL table | Exploring the process of mapping a Python class to a corresponding MySQL table using an ORM framework. Understanding how to define class attributes, relationships, and database mappings to facilitate seamless interaction between your Python code and the database. |
