| 3) Handling Undefined Values | Meaning and how to effectively handle and avoid encountering undefined values in your code |
| 4) Variable Type and Scope Importance | Emphasis on significance of variable types and scopes in JavaScript, showcasing how they impact the behavior and lifecycle of  code |
| 5) Comprehending Closures | How to access variables in its outer (enclosing) scope, even after the outer function has returned|
| 6) Prototypes and Object Inheritance | Employ prototype-based inheritance to enable code reuse and extensibility |
